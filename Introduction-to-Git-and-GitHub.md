## Introduction to Git and GitHub

### What is Git?
- **Git** is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development.
- It helps developers collaborate, manage versions, and keep a history of changes.
- Key features include branching, merging, and the ability to work offline.

### What is GitHub?
- **GitHub** is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides additional features for collaboration.
- It hosts repositories online, allowing multiple developers to work on projects simultaneously.
- Offers tools like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Why Do They Need Git and GitHub?
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project from different locations.
- **Version Control**: Keeps track of changes, so you can revert to previous states if needed.
- **Backup**: Code is stored remotely, reducing the risk of losing work.
- **Documentation**: Changes and project history are documented, making it easier to understand the evolution of the project.
